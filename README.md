Our Idea Solution Prototype:
DOSSIER-DEFENDER
This project is a chatbot designed to enhance cybersecurity awareness. Built using Rasa, the chatbot helps users learn about various aspects of cybersecurity, including phishing attacks, strong password practices, multi-factor authentication (MFA), malware, data privacy, encryption, and more. It provides tips, answers frequently asked questions, and enables users to report issues such as phishing or data breaches.
As the THALES website does not have a chatbot as of 22nd November,2024 our ideation also gives a small suggestion :)
