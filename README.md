Our Idea Solution Prototype:
DOSSIER-DEFENDER
This project is a chatbot designed to enhance cybersecurity awareness. Built using Rasa, the chatbot helps users learn about various aspects of cybersecurity, including phishing attacks, strong password practices, multi-factor authentication (MFA), malware, data privacy, encryption, and more. It provides tips, answers frequently asked questions, and enables users to report issues such as phishing or data breaches. 
As the THALES website does not have a chatbot as of 22nd November,2024 our ideation also gives a small suggestion :)


Features
User-friendly Interaction: Provides concise, easy-to-understand responses to cybersecurity questions.
Cybersecurity Tips: Offers guidance on strong passwords, MFA, firewalls, and encryption.
Reporting Issues: Allows users to report phishing attempts and suspected data breaches.
Prevention Advice: Explains how to avoid malware infections and protect sensitive data.
Customizable: Can be enhanced with further expert suggestions for better
