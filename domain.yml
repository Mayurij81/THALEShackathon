        Cybersecurity is essential to staying safe in today's digital world. Here are some tips:
        - Use unique, strong passwords for every account.
        - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on critical accounts.
        - Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown attachments.
        - Regularly update your devices and software to fix vulnerabilities.
        - Use a reliable antivirus program and a firewall to protect your system.

        Phishing scams are attempts to steal your personal information. If you suspect phishing:
        - Do not click on any links or download attachments in suspicious emails.
        - Verify the sender's email address carefully.
        - Report the phishing attempt to your IT department or forward it to [cybersecurity@domain.com](mailto:cybersecurity@domain.com).
        - You can also report phishing emails to organizations like CERT or your email provider.

        Password security is the foundation of good cybersecurity. Here’s how you can improve yours:
        - Create passwords with at least 12 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
        - Avoid using personal information like names or birthdays.
        - Use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords securely.
        - Change your passwords regularly, especially if you suspect a breach.
        - Never reuse the same password across multiple accounts.

  utter_ask_about_mfa:
    - text: |
        Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounts. Here’s why it's important:
        - It requires something you know (password) and something you have (phone or authentication app).
        - It protects you even if your password is compromised.
        - You can enable MFA on email, social media, banking, and other critical accounts.
        - Authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator are highly secure options.

  utter_ask_about_malware:
    - text: |
        Malware is malicious software designed to harm or exploit devices. To protect against malware:
        - Use a trusted antivirus program and keep it updated.
        - Avoid downloading files or apps from unverified sources.
        - Be cautious about clicking on pop-ups or ads that seem too good to be true.
        - Keep your operating system and software up to date to patch vulnerabilities.
        - Regularly back up your data in case of an attack.

  utter_ask_about_data_privacy:
    - text: |
        Data privacy involves protecting your personal and sensitive information online. Here are some tips:
        - Share as little personal information as possible on social media.
        - Use privacy settings to control who can see your content.
        - Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks like online banking.
        - Use encryption tools for communications and sensitive data storage.
        - Regularly review the privacy policies of the apps and services you use.

  utter_ask_about_firewall:
    - text: |
        A firewall is your first line of defense against unauthorized access. Here's how it helps:
        - It monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
        - It can block malicious traffic and prevent certain attacks.
        - Always ensure your firewall is enabled on your device.
        - For advanced protection, use both software and hardware firewalls.

  utter_ask_about_encryption:
    - text: |
        Encryption is a process that secures your data by converting it into a code that only authorized users can decode. Here's why it's crucial:
        - It protects your sensitive data, such as financial details and personal communications.
        - Always use encrypted tools and services, such as HTTPS websites and encrypted messaging apps.
        - Enable full-disk encryption on your devices for additional security.
        - Remember, encrypted data is much harder for hackers to exploit.

  utter_report_data_breach:
    - text: |
        Data breaches can be alarming, but quick action can minimize the damage:
        - Change the passwords of affected accounts immediately and enable MFA.
        - Monitor your accounts for any unusual activity.
        - Notify the affected service provider or organization about the breach.
        - If sensitive financial data is exposed, alert your bank and consider freezing your credit.
        - Stay updated on the breach and follow guidance from the organization involved.
